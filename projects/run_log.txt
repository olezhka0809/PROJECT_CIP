=== Homomorphic Computation ===
Computing average on encrypted data...
✓ Average temperature (decrypted): 62°C

=== Threshold Check ===
⚠ WARNING: Average temperature EXCEEDS threshold!
  Average: 62°C
  Threshold: 60°C
  Difference: +2°C

=== Security Benefits ===
✓ Individual temps remained encrypted throughout
✓ Server computed average without seeing individual values
✓ Privacy-preserving temperature monitoring
